# User documentation

## Install

Use pip to install `django_docker_engine`, either adding a line to your `requirements.txt`
or on the commandline:
```
$ pip install django_docker_engine
```

## Path vs. hostname routing

There are two ways to map incoming requests to containers. The default is path-based routing, but the domain-name
can also be used.

[Path-based routing](demo_path_routing):
- is simpler, but
- it requires a prefix on every path passed to the containerized webapp.
- ie: You may not use any paths starting with "/".

[Hostname-based routing](demo_host_routing):
- is more complex, because it requires `HostnameRoutingMiddleware`,
- and you will need to set up a wildcard entry in DNS to capture all subdomains.
- but the webapp can use paths starting with "/".


## Docker

`django_docker_engine` tries to abstract away the differences between different ways of running Docker.


### Local Docker Engine

Typically, Docker Engine will be installed and running on the same machine as Django:
Review their [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for the best information,
and then [download](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition) and install.


### Docker Engine on AWS-EC2

The Docker Engine can also be run on a remote machine. `cloudformation_util.py` can either be run
on the command-line, or it can be imported and called within Python to set up a new EC2 with appropriate
security. Once the EC2 is available, it can be provided when constructing `DockerEngineManager`,
either implicitly as an envvar, or explicitly via an instance of the SDK client.

If this will be done automatically, you can ensure that the user has the appropriate privs by running
`set_user_policy.py`.

[Notes on working with AWS](README-AWS.md) are available.


### AWS-ECS

TODO: AWS provides its own wrapper around Docker through ECS. We will need to abstract away what the
Docker SDK provides so that we can use either interface, as needed.


## Launching Containers

`DockerContainerSpec` exposes a subset of Docker functionality so your application can launch containers as needed:

```
$ echo 'Hello World' > /tmp/hello.txt
$ python
>>> from django_docker_engine.docker_utils import (DockerClientWrapper, DockerContainerSpec)
>>> DockerClientWrapper('/tmp/docker', do_input_json_file=True).run(
      DockerContainerSpec(
        image_name='nginx:1.10.3-alpine',
        container_name='my-server',
        container_input_path='/tmp/hello.txt'
      )
    )
$ python manage.py runserver
$ curl http://localhost:8000/docker/my-server/hello.txt
Hello World
```
